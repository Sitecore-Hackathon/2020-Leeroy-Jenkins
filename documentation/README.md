# Documentation

The documentation for this years Hackathon must be provided as a readme in Markdown format as part of your submission. 

You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

Examples of things to include are the following.

## Summary

**Category:** Sitecore Marketplace Website

The purpose of our module is to extend the functionality of the Sitecore Marketplace Website and add new life to it . 
We found that the page is neglected.
We found that a lot of modules use only part of the funtionality that was initially intended. A lot of modules have repeated functionality.
Also the comunity in Sitecore Marketplace does not seem as strong as a few years ago.
Our module intends to light the spark of Sitecore Marketplace once again by introducing a module that lets user put a project with funtionality for a reverse bidding on which he posts the requirements of the project and then all Sitecore Marketplace registered users can enter the bid.
The user will choose from all the participants, also the user can discuss with the participant about the requeriments, business logic to make a deal.

We feel this module will boost the development comunity side of marketplace which is in return what keeps modules up to date.
